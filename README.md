Before submitting a pull request, please make sure the following is done:  Fork the repository and create your branch from master. Run yarn in the repository root. If you've fixed a bug or added code that should be tested, add tests! Ensure the test suite passes (yarn test). Tip: yarn test --watch TestName is helpful in development. Run yarn test-prod to test in the production environment. It supports the same options as yarn test. If you need a debugger, run yarn debug-test --watch TestName, open chrome://inspect, and press "Inspect". Format your code with prettier (yarn prettier). Make sure your code lints (yarn lint). Tip: yarn linc to only check changed files. Run the Flow typechecks (yarn flow). If you haven't already, complete the CLA.
